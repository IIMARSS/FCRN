## Overview
**FCRN** is a novel knowledge distillation based hyperspectral outdoor insulator contamination level recognition network. It effectively integrates state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods to fulfill the growing demand for lightweight yet powerful insulator contamination level recognition models.

## How to start
### *Installation*
**Step 1: Cloning the repository**<br>
```
git clone https://github.com/IIMARSS/FCRN.git
```
**Step 2: Environment setup**<br>
Following the requirements and installing the packages.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### *Data preparation*
Downloading the insulator contamination HSI datasets from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u48ZmYHVyNuiqHAcVywEm-Bh1HghumuL/view?usp=drive_link) or [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1sWUwkPWzrYLBcNUqadY09Q?pwd=2333) and putting them under the [Datasets] folder. Of course, you can use the public HSI datasets or your own datasets as well. It will have the following structure:
```
${DATASET_ROOT}   # Dataset root directory
├── Datasets
│   │
│   ├── xianchang1        # Sunny condition
│   │   ├──xianchang1_2.mat
│   │   ├──xianchang1_2_gt.mat
│   │
│   ├── xianchang2  # Cloudy condition
│   │   ├──xianchang2.mat
│   │   ├──xianchang2_gt.mat
│   │
│   ├── ip         # Indian Pines data	
│   │   ├──Indian_pines_corrected.mat
│   │   ├──Indian_pines_gt.mat 
│   │
│   ├── other HSI Datasets   
│   │   ├ ... 
│   │    

```
### *Running the code*
```
python main.py --model kd --dataset xianchang1
```
